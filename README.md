# Sentiment Analysis Documentation

This repository contains code for sentiment analysis using SVM (Support Vector Machine). The code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries such as NLTK, Sastrawi, and scikit-learn. The code is designed to be run in Google Colab.

## Usage in Google Colab

1. Open the notebook:

   - Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
   - Click on **File > Open Notebook**
   - Select the **GitHub** tab
   - Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis`
   - Click on the notebook file: `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`

2. Mount Google Drive:

   - In the notebook, click on the **Mount Drive** button.
   - Follow the instructions to authorize Google Colab to access your Google Drive.
   - After successful authorization, your Google Drive will be mounted.

3. Prepare the dataset:

   - Upload your dataset file (`your-dataset.csv`) to the **Files** section in the left sidebar of the Colab notebook.
   - Make note of the file path in Google Drive.

4. Update the file path:

   - In the Colab notebook, locate the code cell where the dataset file path is specified.
   - Update the file path with the path of your dataset file in Google Drive.

5. Run the notebook:

   - Click on the **Runtime** menu and select **Run All**.
   - The notebook will execute all the code cells sequentially.
   - Monitor the output and follow the instructions if any additional inputs are required.

6. Evaluate the results:

   - After the notebook has finished running, you can evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis by reviewing the output and metrics calculated.
   - The labeled dataset and evaluation results will be displayed in the output cells.

7. Experiment with different settings:

   - You can experiment with different preprocessing techniques, feature representations, or machine learning models by modifying the code in the notebook.
   - Feel free to explore the possibilities and customize the code to suit your needs.

8. Documentation and further improvements:

   - You can refer to the comments in the code for detailed explanations of each step.
   - If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to contribute by creating a pull request or opening an issue.
